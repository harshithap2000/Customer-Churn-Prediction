# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Customer churn is a common problem across businesses in many sectors. If you want to grow as a company, you must invest in acquiring new clients. Every time a client leaves, it represents a significant investment lost. Both time and effort need to be channeled into replacing them. Being able to predict when a client is likely to leave, and offer them incentives to stay, can offer huge savings to a business. 
As a result, understanding what keeps customers engaged is extremely valuable knowledge, as it can help you to develop your retention strategies, and to roll out operational practices aimed at keeping customers from walking out the door.
